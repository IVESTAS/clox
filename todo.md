- [x] Constant instructions
- [ ] Devise an encoding (RLE) that compresses the line information for a series of 
        instructions on the same line. Change writeChunk() to write this compressed 
        form, and implement a getLine() function that, given the index of an 
        instruction, determines the line where the instruction occurs.
